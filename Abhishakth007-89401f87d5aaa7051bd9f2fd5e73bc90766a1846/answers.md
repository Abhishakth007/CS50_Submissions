# From the Deep

In this problem, you'll write freeform responses to the questions provided in the specification.

## Random Partitioning

Distributing data across all the boats is a good idea for data backup purposes; however, the drawback is the inefficiency when accessing data from all the boats multiple times. A more efficient approach would be to store data on the boats using shared timestamps for each day.

## Partitioning by Hour

If the data is divided into three fields according to specific time periods, each database will not need to consume more space than necessary. This approach can be more efficient than random partitioning since each database operates within its designated time period.

## Partitioning by Hash Value

Using hash values can reduce database query times by allowing searches based on smaller hash values instead of full dates. Additionally, indexing can further speed up the search process. However, a challenge arises when generating consistent hash values for the same date, as discrepancies may occur if the hashing algorithm does not always produce identical results for the same input.
